# Automatic_Background_Remover

A Web API for automatic background removal using Deep Learning. App is made using Flask and deployed on Heroku.

### Here is the Quick look at it.

# Model Details:

```
CNN Architecture - U-Net with Residual connections
Parameters - 8.9M
Trained on - 64,115 Images
validated on - 2693 Images
batch_size = 32
img_size = (256,256)
Trained for - 13 epochs 
Training time - 80min/epoch on GPUs by Google Colab.

```


Datasets used for training:
- COCO - https://cocodataset.org/#home

The model is trained using modified version of U-NET (https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) Architecture first presented by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, Thomas Brox in 2015.
I have added Residual skip connections in U-NET Model which makes it more robust. 

I can't put model architecture here because of its huuge size. [view here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/G0rav/Automatic_Background_Removal/main/src/Model%20Architecture.png)
